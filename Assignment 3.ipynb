    "1.Compared to the linear model, the non-linear models performed significantly better. In terms of Mean Squared Error (MSE), linear regression had a training score of 110.345501 and a validation score of 95.635335. In contrast, the decision tree had a training score of 47.822974 and a validation score of 74.045335. Random forest had a training score of 30.296363 and a validation score of 47.614708, while gradient boosting achieved a training score of 3.694308 and a validation score of 23.546500. The non-linear models had lower MSE, indicating improved performance. R-squared (R2) scores also showed improvement: linear regression had a training R2 of 0.609071 and a validation R2 of 0.636898, while the non-linear models had R2 scores much closer to 1, signifying better model fit.\n",

    "3.To enhance the accuracy of the tree-based models:\n",
    "a. Prune the tree or reduce the depth of the models to combat overfitting.\n",
    "b. Post-prune the tree by removing nodes with limited information content to simplify the model and prevent overfitting."

    "For the decision tree, the training and validation accuracy was higher than for SVM. this many features can be too much for the model and make it too computationally intensive. This time, for the decision tree, the model seemed to work very well and produced high scores. However, the difference between the training and testing set does indicate some overfitting of the model, causing high variance. The same can be true for the concrete example. The scores were much better than last lab but there might have been some overfitting and the models would benefit from regularization."
